### 3. **Security Response Time (SRT)**
**Definition**: Average time from threat detection to security action

**Measurement**:
- **Formula**: `SRT = Σ(Response Time) / Number of Incidents`
- **Range**: 0ms - 10000ms (lower is better)
- **Target**: < 100ms for critical threats, < 500ms for standard threats

**MCP Framework Advantage**:

- **MCP Framework**: 85ms

---

### 4. **Compliance Coverage Index (CCI)**
**Definition**: Percentage of security standards and regulations covered

**Measurement**:
- **Formula**: `CCI = (Standards Covered / Total Relevant Standards) × 100`
- **Range**: 0% - 100% (higher is better)
- **Target**: > 90% coverage of enterprise security standards

**MCP Framework Advantage**:
- GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001 compliance

### 5. **Scalability Performance Index (SPI)**
**Definition**: System performance under increasing load (agents, requests, tools)

**Measurement**:
- **Formula**: `SPI = (Throughput at 1000 agents / Baseline Throughput) × 100`
- **Range**: 0% - 200% (higher is better)
- **Target**: > 80% performance retention at 10x scale

**MCP Framework Advantage**:
