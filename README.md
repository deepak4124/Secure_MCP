# Secure Dynamic Multi-Agent Systems: Architecture and Task Allocation for MCP Server Networks

## Research Overview

This project addresses critical security vulnerabilities in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server networks by developing a comprehensive security framework for dynamic multi-agent systems.

## Core Research Problems

1. **Security Architecture Problem**: No comprehensive security framework exists for multi-agent MCP environments
2. **Dynamic Agent Discovery & Coordination Problem**: Real-time decision-making challenges in MAS with 14 unique failure modes
3. **Security-Performance Integration Problem**: No research on security vs. performance trade-offs in MCP environments
4. **Trust-Aware Task Allocation Problem**: Managing complex context while ensuring trusted agents handle sensitive tasks
